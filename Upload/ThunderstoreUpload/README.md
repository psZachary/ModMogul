Mod Mogul is an attempt to create helper functions, handlers, dispatchers, etc. which allow mod makers to focus more on making their mod and less on decrypting the game's wandering code pathways

Current Features:
One line Item Registration with Shop, Inventory, and base placeable/buildable prefab
Overload on Item Registration to include Icon path
One line custom glb/glTF model import with material and texture support
One line Register boolean mod settings (Will add floats soon tm).  The settings will appear in a new Mods tab in the Main Menu settings with your mod name delimiting the area.  Will be adding the ability to register in game settings as well (Defined as MainMenu or Both because some settings only make sense to modify outside of a save game [ie: Procedural Generation settings])

Future plans:
Maybe AssetBundles but I hate them deeply. (It drastically limits the number of people that will mod a game if they have to install Unity.  It's just statistics.  They're also more involved to update when the very in dev game changes.)
Any other helper functions/things we can come up with
